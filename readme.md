SocPairScoring
Andrew Fairless, July 2011

This program/macro classifies each social interaction of a pair of mice in their home cage according to their individual, simultaneous social behaviors considered together.  For example, if each mouse was sniffing the body of the other mouse, the pair together would be considered engaged in "body sniff - body sniff."  The classification of the behaviors at each time point is displayed in the output table "SocPairScoresArray".
